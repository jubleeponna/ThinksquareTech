    "Aero_bar3_Modalcontent": "The gimbal works, yes, and has some neat features, but it has issues which is why I had to mark it down to only 2 stars and return it. The biggest issue is the horrible camera mount. Instead of using a common GoPro or sport cam mount, it uses a difficult to use strap clamp, which looks like it will break at some point. It does not fit the new GoPro 8. The mounting technique is very irritating because it doesn't allow the use of their nice camera charging port on many models of cameras unless you turn the camera upside down and then you lose access to either the power button or shutter button, again this wouldn't happen if they used a regular GoPro mount. It is difficult to mount and unmount the camera, far worse than the GoPro frame. While sitting on a table, the gyro drifted and the camera slowly rotated. My initial tests didn't show much if any improvement over the GoPro Hyper Smooth stabilization. You would use this more for smooth panning. I had to return it. I would at least wait until one is available with a regular GoPro mount.",

    "Mech_bar3_Modaldata1": "Aerospace engineers are highly trained and scarce; and they need to focus on core product development and innovation. However, every new product development, manufacture, operations and sustenance involve bulk of engineering processes such as scheduling, budgeting, project tracking and configuration  management, which are considered to be non-core and technical administrative in nature. QuEST understands the challenges faced by the aerospace industry in terms of lack of manpower, lack of process understanding and execution process inconsistency across business units.  Critical but non-core work stretches our clientsâ€™ already overburdened engineers further. Meanwhile, our capability led internal technical reviews and KPI monitoring ensures reduced rework. Process efficiency and productivity improvement are given when you partner with us. Be it cost, quality or time, our engineering process solutions offer customers the best advantage. Focus areas of engineering process services are Project Management Change Management Product Test Services Asset Management Technical Data Management Quality Management ",
